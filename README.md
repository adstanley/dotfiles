# dotfiles

# Installation
To install these dotfiles, either copy config files manually and look what software is needed, or (RECOMMENDED) clone the repo and run the `bspwm-install.sh`script as sudo.

`git clone https://github.com/adstanley/dotfiles && cd dotfiles/ && chmod +x ./download.dotfiles.sh && sudo ./download.dotfiles.sh`

:warning: The script used to install the files will install bspwm and all its needed componets for the rice. Make sure to backup your config first so it doesnt mess up anything. It's also a modified version of the bspwm Community Edition of EndeavourOS so I dont know if it will work on anything other than EndeavourOS

# Manual Installation
